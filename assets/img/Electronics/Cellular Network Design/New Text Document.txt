A cellular network for the town in Maharashtra is designed. Site analysis was done from coverage point of view keeping in mind roads, river,crowded places, densely and sparsely populated areas in the town. Maximum path loss of the system was determined based on maximum transmitted power by the base station and the minimum allowed power by the receiver. Using Extended Hata path loss model cell radius was calculated. Final cellular network was designed for the town which handles handoff using umbrella cell approach. Cell splitting method was implemented for improving the capacity of the system in the crowded area.
