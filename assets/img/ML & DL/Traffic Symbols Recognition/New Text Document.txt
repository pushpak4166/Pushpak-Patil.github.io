In this project, a deep neural network model was built with the help of sequential model available in
Keras that can classify traffic signs into 43 different classes.
 The model was compiled with Adam optimizer which performs well and categorical_crossentropy loss
function was used because we have multiple classes to categorize. The model was trained with the dataset
containing more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. The test accuracy achieved by the model is 95%.
