The project uses OpenCv for reading the videos of the road. The video frames were smoothened using
the GaussianBlur function. Region of interest (ROI) was identified and then edges of the lanes were detected using
Canny method. Further bitwise AND operation was performed between region of interest and masked frame.
 Using Hough Transform the straight lines in the frames were identified. The lines identified were
superimposed on the original frame. Further the lines were optimized by averaging out the slope and y-intercept of
multiple lines into a single line and the lane was obtained.
